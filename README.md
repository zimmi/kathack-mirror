# What?

This is an unofficial mirror of the excellent [http://kathack.com](http://kathack.com) created by Alex Leone, David Nufer and David Truong.
More specifically, the files making up the bookmarklet itself were copied and modified to load from this github repo.

# Why?

The original bookmarklet doesn't support sites using HTTPS, which now is practically all of them.

All Credit goes to the original authors!
